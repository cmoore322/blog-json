    "content": "Growing up in America, we are taught that the foundation of our country is built
    upon the United States Constitution. Most importantly the first amendment which guarantees us our freedom of speech, religion, 
    assembly, the press, and the right to petition. However, the current administration has shown no sign of respecting these freedoms. 
    That is unless you agree with the current agenda. Recently the GOP has slashed funding towards the CPB, which limits the reach of many local broadcasting stations
    under NPR and PBS due to supposed left-wing bias. This along with further retaliation towards outlets such as CBS, NBC, ABC, and more puts many 
    media outlets in a time of uncertainty whether the next headline criticizing the current republican agenda will be their demise. The current agenda has
    completely tarnished what we are supposed to stand for in Western media, and creates a parallel between real life and George Orwell's 1984,
    leaving many Americans feeling like Big Brother is always watching and controlling what you do.",
